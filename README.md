# Brick Lane

_Lightweight Cascading grid layout library_

Brick Lane is a jQuery plugin to place elements in optimal position based on available vertical space, like fitting bricks in a wall.

The project is trying to create a lightweight, scalable version of the famous Masonry plugin.

## Usage

First, include the **Brick Lane** plugin right after **jQuery** to get started.

+ [jquery.brick-lane.min.js](https://github.com/squallstar/brick-lane/blob/master/src/jquery.brick-lane.min.js)

Then, simply as

    $('.mycontainer').brickLane();
