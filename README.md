# BrickLane

_Lightweight Cascading grid layout library_

BrickLane is a jQuery plugin to place elements in optimal position based on available vertical space, like fitting bricks in a wall.

The project is trying to create a lightweight, scalable version of the famous Masonry plugin.

## Usage

First, include the **BrickLane** plugin right after **jQuery** to get started.

+ [jquery.brick-lane.min.js](src/jquery.brick-lane.min.js)

    $('.mycontainer').brickLane();
